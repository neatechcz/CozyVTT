/**
 * The psql arguments a restore runs with.
 *
 * Lifted out of the admin route so the flags that make a restore safe are
 * stated in one place and can be checked by a test. Both of them matter:
 *
 * A backup is written with `pg_dump --clean --if-exists`, so the dump begins by
 * dropping every table it is about to recreate. Run without care, a file that
 * was truncated or corrupted applies those drops, fails partway through
 * recreating them, and leaves the instance with neither the old data nor the
 * new. psql also exits 0 in that case, so the caller reports success.
