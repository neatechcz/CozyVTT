/**
 * The campaign owner cannot be removed from their own campaign.
 *
 * Owning a campaign and running it are separate facts, which is what lets an
 * owner hand the DM seat to someone else and stay at the table as a player.
 * `canTransferDM` documents the guarantee that goes with it: the owner keeps
 * the right to take the seat back, "so a campaign they own cannot be locked
 * away from them by whoever holds the seat".
 *
 * Removing a member only refused to remove the sitting DM, so the new DM could
 * remove the owner outright. There was no way back: taking the seat back
 * requires being a member, and the only route that adds a member is the DM's.
 * The owner's one remaining power was deleting the whole campaign.
 *
 * Requires PostgreSQL at DATABASE_URL.
