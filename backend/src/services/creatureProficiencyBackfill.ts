/**
 * creatureProficiencyBackfill.ts
 * Records *why* a seeded SRD creature's saves and skills are what they are.
 *
 * SRD creatures are imported from Open5e, which supplies only final totals — a
 * Goblin arrives as `{ stealth: 6 }` with no indication that this is Dex +2 plus
 * a doubled proficiency bonus. Without that, the editor cannot show the right
 * checkboxes and the rules model has nothing to work from.
 *
 * Two hard rules, both enforced by tests:
 *
 *  1. **No printed number changes.** This records structure alongside the
 *     existing totals; it never recomputes a bonus. A value that cannot be
 *     reconciled with the rules is marked 'custom' and left exactly as it is,
 *     not "corrected".
 *  2. **SRD creatures only.** Rows with any other `source` are never read or
 *     written. A DM's homebrew is their own.
 *
 * It also normalises Open5e's snake_case skill keys ("animal_handling") onto the
 * canonical camelCase ones. That is a key change, not a value change, and fixes
 * a live defect: those keys never matched the skill lookup, so those skills lost
 * their ability association in the roll picker.
