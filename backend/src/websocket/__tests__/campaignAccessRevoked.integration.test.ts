/**
 * Removing someone from a campaign reaching a connection that is already open.
 *
 * A socket reads its campaign and role once, when it authenticates, and every
 * handler trusts that from then on. Changing the DM seat already pushed the new
 * role to live connections. Removing a member did not, so a player the DM had
 * just removed kept sending chat and dice and kept receiving everything the
 * table did, for as long as they left the tab open.
 *
 * These drive the real socket server and assert on the same connection before
 * and after. A reconnect would prove nothing, because a fresh socket is
 * refused at authentication anyway.
 *
 * Requires PostgreSQL at DATABASE_URL.
