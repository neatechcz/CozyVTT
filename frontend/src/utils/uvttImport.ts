// ============================================
// Importing a Universal VTT file
//
// A UVTT holds one map image and the geometry that belongs with it. Two things
// about a file can need the DM's answer before it becomes a map.
//
// Some exporters crop the image to part of the map and then write out the walls
// for the whole of it, so the import would land a map with bare areas and walls
// standing in them. Those walls cannot even block sight, because the visibility
// pass stops at the map's own edges.
//
// And a file may carry walls for its furniture, pillars and crates, kept apart
// from the architecture in `objects_line_of_sight`. They block sight like any
// other wall, but whether a table should is the DM's call.
//
// The server answers 409 with `UVTT_IMPORT_NEEDS_CONFIRMATION` and creates
// nothing until it is told to go ahead. What follows reads that reply and puts
// it into words.
