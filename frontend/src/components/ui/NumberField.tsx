/**
 * A number input you can actually clear and retype.
 *
 * The sheets used to write `parseInt(e.target.value) || <default>` straight into
 * form state, which makes an empty box unrepresentable: deleting the contents
 * snapped the field to its default, and the next keystroke appended to *that*.
 * Selecting "10" and typing "18" gave you something other than 18, which is why
 * players described the ability scores as unusable.
 *
 * The fix is to keep the box's text separate from the committed number while it
 * is being edited. An empty box stays empty, a value is committed as soon as it
 * parses, and range correction happens on blur rather than on every keystroke —
 * clamping mid-type is what turns "1" on the way to "18" into "10".
 *
 * Styling is entirely the caller's: these inputs sit on a coloured sheet header
 * in some places and a white panel in others, so the component takes `className`
 * and adds nothing of its own.
