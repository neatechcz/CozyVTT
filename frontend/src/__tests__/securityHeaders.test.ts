/**
 * The security headers the app page is served with.
 *
 * These live in nginx configuration, so nothing in the application would fail
 * if they were weakened or dropped; the app works fine with no policy at all,
 * which is exactly how it shipped without one. This reads the files instead.
 *
 * Two things are pinned. First, the directives that make the policy worth
 * having, chief among them a script-src with no 'unsafe-inline': the built page
 * has no inline script, so injected markup cannot execute, and that is the
 * whole point.
 *
 * Second, the nginx inheritance trap. A location block that sets any add_header
 * of its own silently discards every add_header from the enclosing server
 * block, and `try_files` sends `/` through the `= /index.html` block. A policy
 * written once at server level therefore reaches nothing. Every location has to
 * include the file, so that is asserted per block rather than trusted.
